# Coding Challenge - Starbucks Store Locator

## Description:

*Exercise

Write clean Pyspark code to answer any two of the following questions. 
Please refrain from using embedded queries in the code. Pyspark.sql.functions is preferred over sql queries.

Proper comments and unit test cases are appreciated. The way the answer is approached is as important as the answer itself.

Share the output & the code via a github repo.

*Questions :

1) Which is the most isolated Starbucks store in Australia ?
2) Which country has the least number of Starbucks stores ?
3) How many stores in Sydney has not updated the "Phone Number" in this dataset ?
4) Which city has the highest number of "Company Owned" Starbuck stores ?
